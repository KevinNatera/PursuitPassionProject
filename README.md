# PursuitPassionProject


The app is currently in MVP, the core battle flow has been established along with a very rough draft of UI Elements.
At the moment, the enemy has 3 different attacks which are chosen at random, and the player has a default attack along with one ability.
In order to further flesh out this app, more hero abilities in addition to items will be added, along with some actual battle animations
besides the hero and the enemy receiving damage.
